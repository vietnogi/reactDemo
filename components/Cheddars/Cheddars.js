      <p>Cheddar cheese is a relatively hard, off-white (or orange if spices such as annatto are added), sometimes sharp-tasting (i.e., bitter[1]), natural cheese. Originating in the British village of Cheddar in Somerset,[2] cheeses of this style are produced beyond this region and in several countries around the world.</p>

      <p>Cheddar is the most popular type of cheese in the UK, accounting for 51% of the country's Â£1.9 billion annual cheese market.[3] It is also the second-most popular cheese in the US (behind mozzarella), with an average annual consumption of 10 lb (4.5 kg) per capita.[4] The US produced approximately 3,000,000,000 lb (1,300,000 long tons; 1,400,000 tonnes) in 2014,[5] and the UK 258,000 long tons (262,000 tonnes) in 2008.[6]</p>
